# Zefania Magento-Admin

THIS IS NOT FOR MAGENTO 2 !!!!


This extension creates a totally new skin for the administration tool. It creates toggleable menu on the left side, enhances graphic design, new font, colors, newly designed table highlighters, etc.

Works well on Magento 1.9. 

Should also be good for version 1.8. and 1.7, not yet tested though.


Installation:

Make sure to backup your data before installing. 

Upload the files to your root magento folder. No core files will be overriden.



In case there is a conflict with any of your extensions, make sure to revert to your backup version. I am not responsible for any potential installation breaks.
