# Zefania Magento-Admin

THIS IS NOT FOR MAGENTO 2 !!!!


This extension creates a new skin for the administration tool. It creates a hideable menu on the left instead on top, enhances graphic design, new font, colors, newly designed table highlighters, etc. The new skin design is highly responsive and optimized for PCs, Tablets, SmartPhones.

Tested and working well in Magento 1.9.x 

Should also be good for version 1.8. and 1.7, though I have not tested in these versions.


Installation:

Make sure to backup your data before installing. 

Upload the files to your root magento folder. No core files will be overriden.



In case there is a conflict with any of your extensions, make sure to revert to your backup version. I am not responsible for any potential installation breaks.
