# magento-admin

THIS IS NOT FOR MAGENTO 2 !!!!


Works well on Magento 1.9. 

Should also be good for version 1.8. and 1.7, not yet tested though.


Installation:

Make sure to backup your data before installing. 

Upload the files to your root magento folder. No core files will be overriden.



In case there is a conflict with any of your extensions, make sure to revert to your backup version. I am not responsible for any potential installation breaks.
